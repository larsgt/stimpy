Simplies runner for SeqWare 
---------------------------

THIS SOFTWARE IS SUPER BETA AND A PROOF OF CONCEPT!

This is a tool for reducing the overhead of wrapping tools inside SeqWare 
workflows. It consists of two main components. One is a set of tools to 
make it easier to get started with SeqWare, the second is a Groovy based 
system for defining workflows based on the same conventions as SeqWare's 
workflow system.  This language enables you to either run the workflow 
in a local context with a logfile or to deploy the workflow to a SeqWare 
environment.

QUICK START
